## Test counts

```
predigy-core       15 tests   (price 4, side 1, position 2, fees 8)
predigy-book        6 tests   (snapshot/delta/gap/wrong-market/edge cases)
predigy-kalshi-rest 6 tests   (auth round-trip, PSS non-determinism, bad PEM,
                               url builder, public client, auth required)
                   ─────────
                   27 tests
```

CI gates (run by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on push to `main` /
`claude/**` and on every PR against `main`):
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  (clippy::pedantic with sensible allows: `module_name_repetitions`,
  `must_use_candidate`, `missing_errors_doc`, `missing_panics_doc`,
  `cast_possible_truncation`, `cast_sign_loss`)
- `cargo test --workspace --locked`

## Confirmed external API contracts

### Kalshi REST
- Base URL: `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
- Auth headers (PSS-SHA256 over `timestamp_ms + method + path`):
  - `KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY`
  - `KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`
  - `KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE` (base64)
- Path = full URL path from API root, no query string.
- Post-Mar-2026 schema: prices are decimals (`yes_price_dollars`); legacy
  integer-cent fields removed.
- Orderbook returns `yes_bids` + `no_bids` only — no asks. YES asks =
  complement of NO bids.

### Kalshi WebSocket (not yet implemented)
- URL: `wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2`
- Same auth headers as REST on the upgrade request.
- Subscriptions: `orderbook_delta`, `ticker`, `trade`, `fill` (auth).
- Snapshots include a sequence number; deltas must be applied in strict order.
- Repeated subscriptions on the same connection are now no-ops (was an error
  pre-2026).

### Kalshi FIX 4.4 (not yet implemented)
- Request access via `[email protected]`.
- Used for order entry/cancel/amend in Phase 2.

### Polymarket WS (not yet implemented)
- URL: `wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/market`
- No auth needed for the public market channel (book + price).
- Used as a reference price; we never execute on Polymarket.

## Known limitations / open items

- **TLS in this sandbox**: outbound TLS to `api.elections.kalshi.com` failed
  with `InvalidCertificate(UnknownIssuer)` — the sandbox proxy doesn't trust
  Kalshi's CA. The code uses `rustls-tls` with `webpki-roots` and works on
  any real network; verify by running `cargo run -p predigy-kalshi-rest
  --example smoke` from your laptop or the production VPS.
- **No live API key tested yet** — `Signer` is unit-test-verified
  (round-trip with the public key) but has not signed a real Kalshi request
  end-to-end.
- **Bare-metal Chicago VPS not yet ordered** — that's a manual vendor
  process; not blocked on code.

## Next chunk to build

Still inside Phase 1:

1. `crates/kalshi-md/` — WebSocket client
   - tokio-tungstenite + rustls-tls; auth headers on upgrade
   - decode `orderbook_snapshot`, `orderbook_delta`, `ticker`, `trade`
   - feed snapshots/deltas into `book::OrderBook`; on `Gap`, fetch a fresh
     REST snapshot and resync
   - reconnect with exponential backoff + jitter
2. `crates/poly-md/` — Polymarket WS client (reference book, no exec)
3. `bin/md-recorder/` — long-running binary that subscribes to a configured
   list of markets and writes raw JSON events to disk (NDJSON in Phase 1,
   parquet rotation in Phase 3)
4. Integration test: feed a captured WS log into a fresh `OrderBook`,
   assert it reconstructs identically to a final REST snapshot

After that, Phase 1 acceptance: 24h of recorded data, replay-vs-snapshot
identical book.

## Build / run

```bash
# All tests
cargo test --workspace

# Lints (CI parity)
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Live read-only smoke test (needs network with public CA roots)
cargo run -p predigy-kalshi-rest --example smoke
```
